# Notebook Structure

This is the structure that the jupyter notebook follows

	1. Read in data

	2. Standardise data

	3. Run elbow curve to determine correct amount of clusters

	4. Cluster data & add new 'cluster' column to full data

	5. Do PCA on the data to get 2 principal components

	6. Plot the clusters to try visualise them

	7. Analyse the clusters to see how young & old people fall into them
